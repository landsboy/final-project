# final-project
repository containing the tool we developed - neoADARtigen:
In order to run the tool, it must be downloaded on our lab servers (because that's where we downloaded the netMHCpan tool and there are other tools used in this repo).
The most_commpn_mut.py file is the main runtime file of the tool
The two scripts written in bash: find.sh and find_seq_of_mutation.sh The first one's job is to find the reading frame from the RefSeq table that we downloaded from the table browser (as we mentioned in the report in the Methods section) and the second script's job is to find the 60 bases around the mutation, the bases it brings From the reference genome
